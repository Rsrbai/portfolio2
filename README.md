# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is a variant of the game Rock Paper Scissors, created by the charactor Sheldon in the big bang theory. This game is a good way to showcase the javascript by providing a website which requires user input and outputs data based on the user input. Creating a simple but fun game for anyone to enjoy.
